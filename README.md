Nexus is a view-orientated Guilded bot template.

## `👀` What is a view-orientated bot?

A view is basically a function that returns an embed, view-orientated bots use views for repetitive embeds that can be handled by a simple function.

## `❔` Why view-orientated?

We use a view-orientated flow as it helps get rid of repetitive code that makes reading and maintaining code harder.
